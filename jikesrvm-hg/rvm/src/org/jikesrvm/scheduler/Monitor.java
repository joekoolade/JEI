/**
 * Implementation of a heavy lock and condition variable implemented using
 * the primitives available from the operating system.  Currently we use
 * a pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_it.  When instantiated, the mutex
 * and cond are allocated.  There is currently no way to destroy either
 * (thus, pool and reuse accordingly).
 * <p>
 * It is perfectly safe to use this throughout the VM for locking.  It is
 * meant to provide roughly the same functionality as Java monitors,
 * except:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This class provides a faster slow path than Java monitors.</li>
 * <li>This class provides a slower fast path than Java monitors.</li>
 * <li>This class does not have any interaction with Thread.interrupt()
 *     or Thread.stop().  Thus, if you block on a lock or a wait and the
 *     calling thread is stopped or interrupted, nothing will happen
 *     until the lock is acquired or the wait is notified.</li>
 * <li>This class will work in the inner guts of the RVM runtime because
 *     it gives you the ability to lock and unlock, as well as wait and
 *     notify, without using any other VM runtime functionality.</li>
 * <li>This class allows you to optionally block without letting the thread
 *     system know that you are blocked.  The benefit is that you can
 *     perform synchronization without depending on RVM thread subsystem functionality.
 *     However, most of the time, you should use the methods that inform
 *     the thread system that you are blocking.  Methods that have the
 *     "WithHandshake" suffix will inform the thread system if you are blocked,
 *     while methods that do not have the suffix will either not block
 *     (as is the case with {@link #unlock()} and {@link #broadcast()})
 *     or will block without letting anyone know (like {@link #lockNoHandshake()}
 *     and {@link #waitNoHandshake()}). Not letting the threading
 *     system know that you are blocked may cause things like GC to stall
 *     until you unblock.</li>
 * </ul>
