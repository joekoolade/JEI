## Goals

* Simplified tool chain
  * Java compiler
  * Java JRE
  * Java utilities
* Metacircular; all Java code
* Adaptive optimization
* Self optimizing/tuning
* Small
* Push/pull class/method loading
* Application security
* Application safety
* Scalable
* Java interface to hardware
* Self hosting
* Fast build times
* Easy configuration

## High Level

JOE consists of the following major components: JikesRVM, boot-image-write, MMTK, GNU Classpath, and JAM (Java-on-Any-Machine).

### JikesRVM

Contains the JikesRVM code which includes the compilers, classloader, assemblers, processor architecture, library interfaces, vm magic, runtime, scheduler, and object model classes. These classes are located in jikesrvm-hg/rvm/.

### MMTK

This component provides the memory management subsystem for JikesRVM. The code is located in jikesrvm-hg/MMTK/src/.

### boot-image-writer

![BootImageWriter](/images/BootImageWriter.png "Boot image creation")

The boot-image-writer is a Java program that builds a mockup of the JikesRVM in another JVM that we will call the source JVM. The program acts an object-model translator. It takes the JikesRVM objects running in the source JVM object model and translates them to the JikesRVM object model. When the mockup and translation is complete, the new JikesRMV objects are written into a bootable image that can run on processor. This code is located in jikesrvm-hg/tools/bootImageWriter/src.

### GNU Classpath

This component is an implementation of Javaâ€™s standard library and is located in classpath-0.98/.

### JAM

This component contains the computer hardware and processor interfaces and is located in jam/.
